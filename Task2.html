        Kalyan was born as Konidala Kalyan Babu[21] on 2 September[a] in a Telugu family to Konidala Venkata Rao and
        Anjana Devi in Bapatla,
        Andhra Pradesh.[26][27] Venkata Rao worked as a police constable and was transferred on a regular basis.

        Kalyan was educated at the St. Joseph's High School in Nellore.[28] H
        e was awarded the title "Pawan" during one of his public martial arts presentations.[29] He also holds a black
        belt in Karate.
        Pawan Kalyan, a prominent actor, politician, and social activist, has been a significant figure in Andhra
        Pradesh, particularly in the realm of education. Known for his charismatic presence and dedicated public
        service, Pawan Kalyan has consistently emphasized the importance of education in transforming society. As the
        leader of the Jana Sena Party, he has advocated for educational reforms and better infrastructure in the state's
        educational institutions.

        Born as Konidela Kalyan Babu on September 2, 1971, in Bapatla, Andhra Pradesh, Pawan Kalyan grew up
        understanding the challenges faced by the educational sector in rural and semi-urban areas. His early education
        was completed in Andhra Pradesh, and he later moved to Chennai for further studies. Despite his passion for the
        arts and his eventual career in the film industry, he never lost sight of the significance of education.

        Pawan Kalyan's entry into politics was driven by his desire to address the socio-economic issues in Andhra
        Pradesh, with education being one of his top priorities. He believes that a well-educated population is
        essential for the holistic development of the state. Under his leadership, the Jana Sena Party has put forward
        various initiatives aimed at improving the quality of education and making it accessible to all segments of
        society.

        One of Pawan Kalyan's key proposals has been the establishment of more government schools with better
        facilities, particularly in rural areas. He has stressed the need for qualified teachers, adequate
        infrastructure, and modern teaching aids to enhance the learning experience for students. His vision includes
        the integration of technology in classrooms to provide students with a contemporary education that prepares them
        for global challenges.

        In addition to advocating for primary and secondary education, Pawan Kalyan has also focused on higher
        education. He has called for the establishment of new universities and the improvement of existing ones to
        ensure that students in Andhra Pradesh have access to world-class higher education. Scholarships and financial
        aid for economically disadvantaged students are also a part of his educational reforms agenda.

        Pawan Kalyan's commitment to education is also reflected in his efforts to address the issues of student
        suicides and mental health. Recognizing the immense pressure faced by students, he has proposed counseling
        services and mental health programs in schools and colleges. He believes that a supportive and nurturing
        educational environment is crucial for the overall well-being and success of students.

        Furthermore, Pawan Kalyan has been vocal about the need for vocational training and skill development programs.
        He understands that not all students may pursue academic careers and that vocational training can provide them
        with the necessary skills to secure employment and contribute to the economy. His initiatives aim to bridge the
        gap between education and employability, ensuring that students are equipped with practical skills that are in
        demand in the job market.

        Pawan Kalyan's efforts in the educational sector have garnered widespread support and appreciation from various
        quarters. His holistic approach to education, encompassing primary, secondary, higher, and vocational education,
        highlights his understanding of the diverse needs of students. By focusing on educational reforms, Pawan Kalyan
        aims to create a knowledgeable and skilled workforce that can drive the state's progress and development.

        In conclusion, Pawan Kalyan's dedication to improving education in Andhra Pradesh is evident through his various
        initiatives and proposals. His vision for an educated and skilled society underscores the critical role of
        education in achieving socio-economic development. As he continues to champion the cause of education, Pawan
        Kalyan remains a beacon of hope for many in Andhra Pradesh who aspire for a better and brighter future through
        the power of learning.

        Kalyan founded a political party named Jana Sena Party on 14 March 2014.[66] He wrote a book titled Ism which is
        also the ideology of the Jana Sena party.[67] He met with then Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Prime ministerial
        candidate Narendra Modi to discuss the issues related to both the Telugu states and extended his support.[68] He
        campaigned extensively for the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and BJP alliance in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. He
        opposed Congress party's rule stating the slogan Congress Hatao, Desh Bachao (lit. 'Stop Congress, Save the
        Country' in Hindi).[69] His rallies drew what the Deccan-Journal called "huge crowds" in Andhra Pradesh and
        Telangana.[70] In August 2017, he announced that he intended to enter full-time politics starting October 2017
        once he completes his film commitments.[71]

        Kalyan brought the Uddanam kidney disease crisis to the attention of media and politicians through protests and

        various schemes for the village.[72][73] In November 2016, Kalyan announced that Jana Sena will contest in the

        Samaj Party[85] for the upcoming 2019 elections in both Telugu states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. At the
        same time, when he was actively campaigning for the elections all around Andhra Pradesh, he fell sick and shared
        a few health problems. As he was getting ready for his next round of campaign at Sattenapalle, he felt dizzy and
        nauseated. When the chopper was down for refilling at Gannavaram airport, he was down with vomiting,
        dehydration, and drowsiness. Immediately then, he was hospitalized and treated in Vijayawada. Again the campaign
        resumed after he got well.[86][87]

        workers against YSR Congress Party governance who have been facing unemployment due to shortage of supply of
        sand in Andhra Pradesh.[92]

        Sugali Preethi, a 15-year-old girl who was raped and murdered, in Kurnool.[94] He demanded an inquiry by Central
        Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the incident.[95]

        Kalyan contesting in Pithapuram constituency. He won by a margin of more than 70,000 votes; Jana Sena Party won
